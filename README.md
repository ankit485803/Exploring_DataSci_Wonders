# Data Science Exploration üöÄ

Welcome to the Data Science Exploration repository! This repository is dedicated to augmenting my skills as a data scientist, exploring various data analysis, data preprocessing, and data visualization ideas and techniques.

## Motivation üí°

As a student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna (IIT Patna), I am deeply interested in computer science and data analytics, particularly in the field of data science. This repository serves as a platform for me to document my journey of learning and gaining experience in this exciting field.

## About This Repository ‚ÑπÔ∏è

In this repository, you will find:

- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks and scripts exploring various datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques and methodologies for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations created using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to gain insights from data.
- **Project Work**: Hands-on projects demonstrating the application of data science techniques to real-world problems.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Matlab and Octave**: I'll use Matlab and Octave for numerical computing and prototyping algorithms.
- **Tableau**: For interactive data visualization and dashboards.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Occasionally, I may switch to Jupyter Notebooks for coding purposes while maintaining the same concepts and workflows.
- **Google Colaboratory Notebooks**: I will predominantly use Google Colaboratory for my data science work due to its ease of use and access to powerful computing resources.

## Future Plans üîÆ

In the future, I plan to expand this repository further by:

- Adding more advanced data science projects.
- Exploring machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- Collaborating with others to work on interesting data science projects.
- Sharing my experiences and insights gained along the way.
